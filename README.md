This is basic color changer application where i privided four  diffrent colour box such as green,brown,red,yellow if anyone click one of this box's then the background color of the body will change respective to the given box color like if any one click on the green color box then the background color of the body will change in green colour.
I did this small project in fully dynamic way that means i created all the html elements and all the css styles using the JavaScript.  
Thank You.
